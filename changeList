0.5.1:
Improvements:
- parseAlignment tries to determine input type based on extension (no need to use --format parameter in most cases)

Bug fixes:
- fixed broken extractTranscriptInfo.py and added new 'type' that looks for "gene=<gene name>"

Internals:
- replacing Boost headers with the latest stable version 1.53.0

0.5.0:
Improvements:
- parse alignment can extract and save gene names from Ensembl type reference
- estimateDE now produces comparison for all condition pairs when used with more than 2 conditions
- added --seed option to estimateHyperPar and estimateDE
- estimateHyperPar works in log scale only (it accepts only mean logged expression in --meanFile; and logs expression samples automatically when needed)

Bug fixes:
- fixed output of estimateDE: fold change with confidence intervals are in log2 scale, mean expression in natural log scale
   + changed flag confidencePerc to confidenceInterval and default value to 95
- changed getPPLR so that it produces PPLR comparison in the same "direction" as estimateDE
- fixed problem with long lines in reference sequence file in parseAlignment

Deprecation:
- drop obsolete parseAlignment.py

0.4.3:
- changed order in estimateDE output (logFC ConfidenceLow ConfidenceHigh)
   -> rename to credible intervals ?
- added normalization for getV. estimateDE estimateHP
- estimateE
   - new format in thetaMeans
   - set seed
   - doMax
- drop example.html
- bugfix for parseAlignment
